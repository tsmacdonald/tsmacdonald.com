Praised for his "athletic" and "impressive and stylistically Scottish
playing" (Dr. John Turner & Dr. Melinda Crawford), Tim Macdonald is a
regular performer, scholar, composer, and teacher of early Scottish
fiddle music. His unique combination of years of experience as a folk
dance musician with the carefully-trained technique of a classical
player and the historical rigor of a scholar have taken him from New
York City’s Frick Collection and Scotland's Blair Castle to the
villages of Indonesia, university lecture halls and academic
conferences, countless country and contra dances, and beyond. Tim is
the only US National Scottish Fiddling Champion to win on a Baroque
violin, and he has played with Trio Settecento, the Newberry Consort,
Rachel Barton Pine, and the Mountainside Baroque orchestra, among
other groups. He formed an internationally-touring Scottish fiddle duo
with cellist Jeremy Ward whose "thrilling" music "only [gets] more
thrilling as they shred […] on" (*Chicago Classical Review*). The
duo's debut album, *The Wilds*, is a "fresh and yet authentic sounding”
(Dr. John Purser) celebration of the diversity of Scottish fiddle
music in the 18th century. Learn more at
