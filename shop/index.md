            The Scottish Music does no less honour to the genius of the country.
            The old Scottish songs have always been admired for the wild pathetic
            sweetness which distinguishes them from the music of every other
            country.
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            There is an inherent feeling for wild music in Scottish nature, and
            there is a definite relationship between the rhythms of reels and the
            Highland fling and the music I play.
          </blockquote>

          <p class="top-space">
          <em>Wild.</em> Driving dance tunes, plaintive laments, unusual harmonies,
          surprising forms, fierce songs. From improvised divisions over a ground
          bass to tender-yet-untamed slow airs to a sonata based on a ballad,
          this album showcases the huge range of music played by Scottish
          violinists in the 18th century. The tunes here are different in many
          ways, but they are united in their wildness and their affective power.
          Like others before you, we hope that this idiom moves you: at times to
          dancing, at times to crying, but always to emotion.
