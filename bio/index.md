Praised for his "athletic" and "impressive and stylistically Scottish playing" ([Dr. John
Turner](http://www.fiddletree-music.com/johnturner.html) & [Dr. Melinda Crawford](http://www.melindacrawford.com/)),
Tim Macdonald is a regular performer, scholar, composer, and teacher of early Scottish fiddle music.

Tim was the first US National Scottish Fiddling Champion to win on a Baroque violin, and his performances with [Trio
Settecento](http://www.triosettecento.com/), [Concerto Caledonia](https://concal.org/), [The Newberry
Consort](https://newberryconsort.org/), and many others have taken him from New York City's Frick Collection to the
villages of Indonesia, countless country and contra dances, Scotland's Blair Castle, and beyond.

Favorite projects include helping to perform Scotland's first opera, <i>The Gentle Shepherd</i>, in full for
the first time in over two centuries, lecturing on applying the rhetorical ideas of the Scottish Enlightenment to modern
fiddling, playing fully-staged Elizabethan jigs with [Steve
Player](http://www.strangeandancientinstruments.com/page3/styled-4/index.html), joining classical superstar <a
href="http://rachelbartonpine.com/">Rachel Barton Pine</a> for an encore of traditional tunes following her performance
of Bruch's *Scottish Fantasy*, and serving as music and dancing master at a thoroughly-researched recreation of a 1770s
American tavern.  His radio appearances include WQXR classical radio (New York City), BBC Scotland's <i>Take the
Floor</i>, WGN & WDCB (Chicago), and WBOM (Rockford).

His debut album, [*The Wilds*](http://www.timandjeremy.com/wilds) (with cellist [Jeremy
Ward](http://www.jeremydavidward.com)), celebrates the diversity of Scottish fiddle music in the 18th century, and has
been described as "fresh and yet authentic sounding" ([Dr. John Purser](http://www.johnpurser.net/)) and "a belter"
([Dr. David McGuinness](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/cca/staff/davidmcguinness/)).
