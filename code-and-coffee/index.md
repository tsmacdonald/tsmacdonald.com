## Code and Coffee: Edinburgh Edition

<em>'I wish I had more time to start that side project I've been thinking about…'</em>

<em>'I'm too tired to do more coding when I get home from work…'</em>

What if you got up a little early to have some time for your personal projects? What if you worked on them over coffee
(or tea!) with a community of like-minded makers?

That's what Code & Coffee is all about.

<hr>

Inspired by [its success in Chicago](https://push.cx/code-and-coffee), Tim is bringing it to Edinburgh and organising
the Tuesday meetup on Lothian Rd. Wish it were on a different day or in a different location? Start one yourself!

### Tuesday, Lothian Rd

<em>At Caffè Nero</em> Tuesdays, starting at 7:30am. First date is 14 January, 2025, and it will meet every Tuesday
afterward unless otherwise noted.

### Your Code & Coffee here!

Want to start your own? Do it! <a href="mailto:codeandcoffee@tsmacdonald.com">Contact Tim</a> to get it listed.

## FAQ

<strong>Do I need to RSVP?</strong>

No.

<strong>Is there a fee?</strong>

Just the cost of your drink.

of programmers? <a href="mailto:codeandcoffee@tsmacdonald.com">Contact Tim</a>!)

<strong>I'm running late, should I still come?</strong>

Absolutely! It's very informal. The person you're hurting the most is yourself :)

<strong>What time does it end?</strong>

Some people have work to go around 9, some people might start their day job from the café and stay for longer. Do what
you like!

<strong>Are there any rules?</strong>

Don't harass people ([CodeBase's Code of Conduct](https://www.thisiscodebase.com/code-of-conduct) has a good
definition), don't come for the express purpose of trying to sell something, don't make me expand this list.
